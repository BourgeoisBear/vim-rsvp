Why move your eyes to read--like some filthy peasant--when we have
computers that can move the words for us?  I know, I know.

"`Waaah,` `waah`!  `My` `eyes` `work` `fine`.  `I` `like` `dead` `trees`."

Whatever.

Those of you who already have one foot in the assisted living facility
have my permission to close this window right now (`:bd!`), and enjoy
what precious time you have left.

Ok, they're gone.  Wait, I'm wrong.  We have a straggler.

Let's continue.  Trust me people.  Experts--some even funded by big
companies--have spent decades studying this stuff.  There is no way you're
ever going to read-up on all of the cool things we're putting into the water
to turn the frickin' frogs gay (at least not in this lifetime) when you're
still dragging your eyeballs across some dusty-ass page.

It is time to make Neil DeGrasse Tyson and Bill Nye so proud of you that
they look deeply into each other's eyes--like a proud mama and a proud papa.
So proud, in fact, that they fondly reminisce all the way back to your
conception, and begin lustily pawing at each other in the Hot Topic while
you're trying to pick out a Harry Potter t-shirt and not die from
embarrassment.  How do you do that?  You trust the science bucko, and
you use this plugin!  That's what you do.

Ok.  Now that I've just obliterated you with facts and logic, time to
put yourself back together again so you can use this awesome plugin!

Load a text into a buffer.  Place the cursor where you'd like
to begin reading.  Issue a simple `:RsvpGo` command, and you're off!

When the reader is in `active mode`, use the following keys to:

        ? - display help
        p - enter `pause mode`
        f - go faster
        s - go slower
  <Esc>/q - quit

When the reader is in `pause mode`, use the following keys to:

      w/l - to next word
      h/b - to previous word
      p   - return to `active mode`

These shortcuts are displayed on the message bar while the reader
is engaged.  The cursor is advanced as each word is displayed.
When the reader is disengaged (press `q`), the line being read
is vertically centered with a `zz`.
